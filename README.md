# doc-template README

Work in progress VSCode extension to add documentation templates pulled from a template repo.

## Features

* Command palette option to choose a template and add it to a specified location
* Codelens prompt to insert template content into an empty markdown file
* Additional option in the context menu when right-clicking in the explorer to choose a template and add it to a folder

## Requirements

This extension relies on a GH CLI extension to pull templates and add them to a directory.

## Known Issues

This extension is a WIP and currently uses sample templates.
